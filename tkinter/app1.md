# 项目提案：基于AI的工业生产环境安全监控系统
AI-based industrial production environment safety monitoring system

## 1. 项目背景
在工业生产环境中，工人的健康和安全是至关重要的。然而，目前的监控系统往往需要人工干预，且无法实时准确地检测工人的健康状况。因此，我们计划开发一个基于AI模型的监控系统，用于检测工人是否晕倒或长时间保持静止。

In industrial production environments, the health and safety of workers is of paramount importance. However, current monitoring systems often require manual intervention and cannot accurately detect the health status of workers in real time. Therefore, we plan to develop an AI-based monitoring system to detect if a worker faints or remains still for a long time.

Okay, this is a classic and important computer vision task. We'll use Python with OpenCV for video processing and a pre-trained model for person detection and pose estimation. YOLOv8 by Ultralytics is excellent for this as it offers models that can detect persons and their keypoints (poses) simultaneously.
Here's a plan:
Setup: Install necessary libraries (opencv-python, ultralytics, numpy).
Video Input: Read the RTSP stream using OpenCV.
Person Detection & Pose Estimation: Use YOLOv8-Pose to detect people and their body keypoints in each frame.
Tracking (Simplified): We need to track individuals across frames to monitor their state over time. For simplicity, we'll use a basic IOU (Intersection over Union) tracker or assign IDs based on detection order if only one person is expected. A more robust solution would use dedicated trackers like SORT or DeepSORT.
Stillness Detection Logic:
For each tracked person, record their keypoint positions.
If the average movement of keypoints over a certain number of frames (e.g., 5-10 seconds) is below a threshold, flag them as "still."
Fainting Detection Logic:
Monitor the vertical position of key upper body keypoints (e.g., head, shoulders, hips).
A sudden, rapid drop in the average vertical position of these keypoints can indicate a fall.
Additionally, check the person's posture after the drop. If they are predominantly horizontal (e.g., bounding box of keypoints is wider than tall), it's a strong indicator of a faint/fall.
Alerting: When a condition is met, print an alert to the console and draw on the video frame.
Configuration: Make thresholds (stillness duration, movement amount, fall velocity, etc.) configurable.
Let's start coding.
Prerequisites:
Make sure you have Python installed. Then install the libraries:
pip install opencv-python ultralytics numpy
Use code with caution.
Bash
Python Code:
app.py

Explanation and How to Use:
Replace RTSP_URL: Change "rtsp://your_rtsp_stream_url_here" to your actual RTSP stream URL. You can also use a local video file path for testing (e.g., "my_test_video.mp4").
Model (POSE_MODEL_PATH): The script uses yolov8s-pose.pt by default. If you run it for the first time, Ultralytics will download this model. You can choose other variants like yolov8n-pose.pt (faster, less accurate) or larger ones (slower, more accurate).
Configuration Parameters:
STILLNESS_DURATION_THRESHOLD_SEC: How long a worker needs to be relatively motionless to trigger a "still for too long" alert.
MOVEMENT_THRESHOLD_PIXELS: The average pixel movement of keypoints. If below this, the person is considered still for that frame.
FAINT_DETECTION_WINDOW_SEC: How quickly the fall must happen.
MIN_VERTICAL_DROP_RATIO: How far (as a percentage of their height) a worker must drop to be considered a potential fall.
HORIZONTAL_ASPECT_RATIO_THRESHOLD: If the width-to-height ratio of the person's keypoints bounding box exceeds this after a drop, it strongly suggests they are lying down.
IOU_THRESHOLD & MAX_ABSENT_FRAMES: For the simple tracker.
Running the Script: Save it as a Python file (e.g., monitor_worker.py) and run python monitor_worker.py from your terminal.
Output:
A window will pop up showing the video feed with bounding boxes around detected people, their keypoints, and status labels ("FAINTED", "STILL TOO LONG").
Alerts will also be printed to the console.
Important Considerations & Potential Improvements:
RTSP Stream Stability & Latency: RTSP streams can be unreliable or have significant latency. The script includes a basic reconnect attempt (commented out) but robust handling might be needed.
Computational Load: Pose estimation is computationally intensive. If processing a high-resolution stream or multiple people, you might need a powerful GPU. Consider:
Using a smaller YOLO model (e.g., yolov8n-pose.pt).
Reducing the input frame size before processing (though this can affect detection accuracy).
Processing frames at a lower rate (e.g., skip every other frame), but this can miss fast events.
Tracking Robustness: The IOU-based tracker is very basic. For environments with multiple people or frequent occlusions, a more sophisticated tracker like SORT, DeepSORT, or ByteTrack (often available in detection libraries or as separate packages) would be much better.
Threshold Tuning: The default thresholds are starting points. You'll need to tune them extensively based on your specific camera angles, lighting conditions, worker activity patterns, and desired sensitivity.
False Positives/Negatives:
Stillness: Workers might be still while concentrating. The duration threshold is key here.
Fainting: Bending down quickly to pick something up might trigger a false positive. The combination of rapid drop AND horizontal posture helps, but it's not foolproof. Sudden camera movements could also cause issues if not handled.
Camera Angle: A top-down or high-angle view is generally better for monitoring activity and detecting falls than a side-on view at human height.
Environmental Factors: Poor lighting, occlusions (e.g., machinery, other workers), and cluttered backgrounds can significantly impact detection and pose estimation accuracy.
Alerting Mechanism: Currently, it just prints to console and draws on the frame. For a real system, you'd integrate this with actual alerting systems (e.g., sending an email, SMS, triggering an alarm, API call to a security system).
Keypoint Visibility: The code does a basic check (px > 0 and py > 0) for keypoint visibility. YOLOv8-Pose also provides confidence scores for each keypoint (results[0].keypoints.conf), which could be used for more robust filtering of unreliable keypoints.
This system provides a solid foundation. Remember that real-world deployment requires careful testing, tuning, and consideration of the specific industrial environment.
